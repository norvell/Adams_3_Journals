How do you add an image to a slick game?
By senting the image to your res and it will pop up somewhere
Where is the image drawn? [What code? Be specific.]
class Item {
	public int x;
	public int y;
	public boolean isvisible = true;
	Image currentImage;
	Shape hitbox;
	Image healthpotion = new Image(
			"res/health_potion.png");

	Item(int a, int b) throws SlickException {
		this.x = a;
		this.y = b;
		this.hitbox = new Rectangle(a, b, 32, 32);// 64 is the width of the item
		this.currentImage = healthpotion;
