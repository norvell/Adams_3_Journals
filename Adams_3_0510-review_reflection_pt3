Create a class for 'Hero' The class should contain:
variables for health, score, power/weapon, dexterity, perception, level, x, y, z, and a symbol
class Hero{
int health;
int score;
String weapon;
int dexterityLvl;
int level;
public int x;
public int y;
public int z;
String symbol = " @";
double perception;
}
There should also be a class constructor accepting inputs for name, x, y, and symbol
public class Hero {

    public int x;
    public int y;
    String symbol = " @";
    public String name = "Norvell";


    Hero(int a, int b) {

        this.x = a;
        this.y = b;

    }
}
Provide an example of initializing a hero object with your name
Hero Norvell;
Explain why you would not initialize the hero in class hero.
because then the class would be an object in its own class. Instead of the object working in the
main game, because you are making the object in the class instead of the main program.
