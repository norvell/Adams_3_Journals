1.What is the difference between Player and player?
The Player is a class- a class is a subset of instructions within a java program, used for ENCAPSULATION (making the code modular for organization and efficiency) e.g. as a template(recipe) for making objects.
player is an object made from the Player class.

2. What is a class constructor and how is it used?
<<inside the Block class i.e. Block java>>
public Blocked(int x, int y){
        this.width = x;
         this.height = y;
          this.invisible = true;
}
Block block = new Block(64, 64);
3. What does “static” do?
Static shares that value across the class;
this would be good for ______,
and this would be really bad for player status.

4. Why did programs break when switching to player?
A.Some people  didn’t instantiate a player object
B.Some programs still referred to the Player class
C.This would make another player object impossible

5. What does it mean to declare?
You state what you will be using e.g. reserving a space or period.
6. How did we declare a player object?
 Player player;

7. How did we initialize a player object?
player = new Player();

8. How can we access the player OBJECT from win and lose?
make a static player object, which can be reference in order classes
then you would put the name of the game class and the player .i.e.
ChallengeGame;player.setX(); 


9.What does this code do?
   public Main(String gamename) {
      super(gamename);
       this.addState(new Menu(xSize, ySize));
        this.addState(new WorldOfFunLvl1(xSize, ySize);
        this.addState(new lose(xSize, ySize);
}
We made a specific type of slick game, a “state-based” game.
this method is adding all of the states so they are ready to be called.

10.what is a “class”?
a subsection of a java program.
