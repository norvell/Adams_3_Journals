Write a Java method to return the cubed value of some number.

 public static void cubeIT(int x){
        int a = x*x*x;
         return int a;
 }

Write an Arduino function to return the cubed value of some number.

void loop() {
  int i = 5;
  int squared;
  int cubed;

  squared = i * i;
  cubed = i * squared;

        return cubed;

Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student

public class Student {
        int hairLength;
        int age;
        string hairColor;
        int grade;
        public Student(int a, int b, string c, int d){
                this.hairLength = a;
                this.age = b;
                this.hairColor = c;
                this.grade = d;

     }
  }
}

Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?

I would create a beat maker with multiple speakers and button beside each speaker so you can 
control them.
