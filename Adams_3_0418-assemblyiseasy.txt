1. to Help the program run
2. to find the saved file you were looking for.
3. Because elf64 is basically the same thing chmod.
4. Code Below:

global  _start

        section .text
_start:
       ;write(1, message, 13)
       mov    rax, 1                      ; system call 1 is write
       mov    rdi, 1                      ; file handle 1 is write
       mov    rsi, message                ; address of strngs to output
       mov    rdx, 15                     ; number of bytes
       syscall                            ; invoke operating system to do the write

       ; exit(0)
       mov   eax, 60                      ; system call 60 is exit
       xor   rdi, rdi                     ; exit code 0
       syscall                            ; invoke operating system to exit
message:
        db  "Norvell Adams" , 12           ; note the newline at the end

5. I had to solve the numbers in order to show my full name.
6. Yes ,because it is faster than java and it's more advanced than java.
7. Low level probably means that it requires less code than a regular java program which helps it run
smoothly.
