For what computational reason did you type elf64?
	That is the operating system.
Why did you use ld?
	It invokes the linker
Why did you not have to use chmod to make sample executable?
	chmod is for permissions.
Now - change the code to print your name. You should change the program so that it actually prints your name.
Post the code in your journal

4. Code Below:

global  _start

        section .text
_start:
       ;write(1, message, 13)
       mov    rax, 1                      ; system call 1 is write
       mov    rdi, 1                      ; file handle 1 is write
       mov    rsi, message                ; address of strngs to output
       mov    rdx, 20                     ; number of bytes
       syscall                            ; invoke operating system to do the write

       ; exit(0)
       mov   eax, 60                      ; system call 60 is exit
       xor   rdi, rdi                     ; exit code 0
       syscall                            ; invoke operating system to exit
message:
        db  "Norvell Adams" , 10           ; note the newline at the end

What problem did you have to solve to get it to work?
	You had to recomplie your code and make the byte size a larger number if it exceeded the original 13
Given your actual experience with Assembly now --- Is assembly 'quick and easy'? Why or why not?
	No it is not "quick and easy" thought to be low level as in basic, like primative, I thought
	it would have been easy, but it is low level as in you work more with the computer
What does 'low level' actually mean with regards to programming languages?
	It is a lot closer to what the computer reads.
