Why Ballmer called linux a cancer? "Linux is not in the public domain. Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an 
intellectual property sense to everything it touches. That's the way that the license works."
Ballmer was trying to articulate his concern, whether real or imagined, that limited recourse to the GNU GPL requires that all software be made open source.
